# Client Side Give
Minecraft Fabric mod that adds a /clientgive command to get items client side  
Items will become real if you are in creative mode and open your inventory after getting the item

### Syntax
`/clientgive <item> [<count>]`  
You can use [item components](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format#List_of_components), for example `/clientgive minecraft:diamond_sword[minecraft:damage=50]` will give you a diamond sword with 50 durability taken off from it

### Note
Use this on servers at your own risk! Things like placing client side blocks then jumping onto them may trigger servers' anticheats
